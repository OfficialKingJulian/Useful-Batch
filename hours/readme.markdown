# Hours VBScript

A tiny script to keep track of hours I've worked, using a CSV file. Written with VBScript for simplicity (at least, compared to batch). 

## Usage

Although the VBScript is called `clock.vbs`, `cl.bat` (and therefore the command `cl`) is what actually activates the script. Running the `clock` command without the help of `cl.bat` adds ugly stuff to your CMD.

`cl in` - Clock in at current time

`cl out` - Clock out at current time
