# dotbatch

Some useful windows dotfiles and/or batch scripts I use fairly regulary.

## Installation: 

AutoHotkey is required to get everything to work as desired. 

Simply...

`git clone https://github.com/OfficialKingJulian/dotbatch`

`cd Useful-Batch`

`dotbatch -install`

Then reload the Command Prompt. To remove, it's the same but with: 

`dotbatch -uninstall`

## cmdrc.bat 

Press `alt+enter` to run the Command Prompt (an AHK script). This runs it through the script cmdrc.bat, which alters the look of the prompt.
